# Cashflow Screen — Element Inventory v1

**Screen:** Sonuswealth Cashflow (build target: React in `src/screens/Cashflow.jsx`)
**Design baseline:** none on disk — Stitch HTML for Cashflow not in scope. Walked component as structural truth.
**Reconciliation baseline:** engine — `src/engine/fq-calculator.js` (+ `src/engine/timeline-engine.js`); CMA bundle `src/rules/cma-2026.json`.
**Intent reference (NOT a conformance target):** `2-Product/2-Product-cashflow-v1_7.md` — single-scroll §A NOW → §B TRAJECTORY → §C DEPTH; use only for engine fn names, plain-English standard, FCA framing.
**Date:** 17 May 2026

## Why this file exists

This is the **fixed target** the whole Cashflow audit measures against. Every interactive or
data-bearing element on Cashflow is one numbered row. The audit does not "find mistakes" —
it walks this list and records a verdict per row. That is the only thing that makes
"99% confident" a real statement: it means *N of M rows verified PASS*, not a feeling.

**This file is the worksheet.** Auditor agents fill the `Verdict` columns. Do not add
or remove rows except via the "inventory drift" rule in the runbook. If the build
contains an element not listed here, that is itself a finding (`UNLISTED`).

---

## The six assertions (every row is tested against all six)

| # | Assertion | Fails when… |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| A1 | **Identified** — element exists in the build and matches this row | Element missing from build, or build has an element not in this inventory |
| A2 | **Drillable** — if it is a number, action, or nav element, interacting with it does something | Tapping is dead / no handler / no visible response |
| A3 | **Destination correct** — it resolves to the surface that **owns its subject** | A pension drawdown action lands on T&E; a tax-band number lands on Risk; etc. |
| A4 | **Destination coherent** — the landing is a usable continuation: it shows the SOURCE, an ACTION, or a DECISION | Lands on a generic modal, a dead-end, a screen top with no context, or an unrelated view |
| A5 | **Plain English** — label + any explainer readable by a non-expert in one pass; jargon translated; information-not-advice (FCA) | Unexplained jargon ("PRC/PCC spread", "PoS", "Guyton-Klinger", "Reality Engine") with no plain explainer; advice-phrased copy |
| A6 | **Reconciled** — every number traces to an engine function and matches value + format everywhere it appears | Hardcoded number; `fmt()` not used; same metric shows two values/formats; default mocks rendered as real engine output |

**Drill destination taxonomy (A3 + A4).** Every drillable element must resolve to one of:
- **SOURCE** — the breakdown / detail / provenance of where a number came from.
- **ACTION** — a place to *do* the thing (a panel, a flow).
- **DECISION** — a place to weigh options and commit (scenario engine, plan).

If a drillable element resolves to *none* of these, A4 = FAIL.

**Verdict values:** `PASS` · `FAIL` · `NA` · `UNVERIFIED` (default) · `BLOCKED` (cannot test).
**Severity (set by orchestrator on any FAIL):** `DEMO-BLOCKING` · `FUNCTIONAL` · `POLISH`.

## Confirmed founder decisions (auditors treat these as fixed — do NOT flag against the stale spec)

| FD | Decision |
|----|----------|
| FD-NAME-1 | **Product name is `Sonuswealth` (D-NAME-2, locked 9 May 2026 — supersedes Caelixa and Finio).** Source of truth: `src/config/brand.js` (`BRAND.name`). Casing: logo / wordmark = `sonuswealth` (lowercase, see `BRAND.nameDisplay`); body text, titles, aria-labels, page `<title>`, score strings = `Sonuswealth` (sentence case). Every `Caelixa` or `Finio` in user-facing strings = FUNCTIONAL FAIL (A5/A6). Engine-module disclaimers + comments are queued for Wave 4 Morph sweep. |
| FD-CROSS-1 | **Every critical action is a surface-instance, not a pointer.** Each surface presents the *angle it owns* with its own layout and its own data evidence; cross-surface links are explicit. On Cashflow, the screen owns **£/month effect** — monthly inflow change, tax-band ordering, sequence risk on cash, surplus allocation. A pension-drawdown affordance surfaced here owns the *cash-impact view* of drawdown; the canonical "doing" surface for actually starting drawdown is My Money. The drill-rule (A3) is satisfied when each Cashflow instance drills to *its own* cash-effect detail, not to T&E's IHT consequence or Risk's volatility consequence. |
| FD-LOGO-1 | Brand assets live at `G:\My Drive\All Work\6.Finio\1-Clusters\Codex UI\deliverables\sonuswealth-site\assets\{favicons,logo,mascot,videos}`. Conformance-auditor checks that every surface uses the right logo variant per theme (light/dark) and flags the faded-purple dark variant as DEMO-BLOCKING wherever it appears below WCAG AA contrast. (Cashflow has no logo render — confirm absence is intentional.) |
| FD-MASCOT-1 | Mascot is **Sonnu (owl)**, 6 life-stage forms. Placement on screens is **Wave 7 enhancement scope**, not in-audit; audit treats absence of Sonnu as not-a-finding. |
| FD-CF-1 | **Funded-ratio label bug (commit `533a8c0`) was fixed.** The `ConfidenceIntervalSummary` row for "Funded ratio" was previously rendering `fr.confidence` ("HIGH") — which is calculation certainty, not the ratio status — making a 0.32 ratio appear as "HIGH" (i.e. healthy). Code now derives a status label (`Over-funded` / `On track` / `Approaching target` / `Under-funded`) from `fr.ratio` directly (`Cashflow.jsx` §C.8, lines 2655–2700). Stage B verifies the fix held across personas and that no other surface still reads `fr.confidence` as a status. |

## ELEMENT TABLE

> `Owns-subject destination` is the **expected** A3/A4 target — the auditor checks the
> build against this. Where it reads "dedicated panel," a coherent in-context drill
> (overlay or sub-screen) is acceptable; a bare tab-jump is not.

## SEED FINDINGS (pre-identified — agents start with these, then extend)

These are *already known* from reading the React component. They are not the list — they
are the proof the method works. Agents must confirm each, assign severity, and find the rest.

| Seed | Element(s) | Issue | Likely severity |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| S-01 | CF-X28-01 | Initial `windowId` state in `Cashflow.jsx` is `'current-tax-year'` but `X28TopBar.TIME_WINDOWS` uses id `'current-period'` — id mismatch means the controlled top bar can't find the window and silently falls back to a default. Default-state desync. | FUNCTIONAL |
| S-02 | CF-POSC-02, CF-SEQ-03/04, CF-EFF-01, CF-SCEN-02 | V2 chart components (`PoSChartV2`, `SequenceStressVisV2`, `EfficientFrontierV2`, `ScenarioMatrixV2`) fall back to **synthetic mock series** (e.g. `1_000_000 × 1.045^i`, hardcoded 5 scenarios with PoS 0.94/0.88/0.97/0.68) when their props are null. Cashflow renders them with engine-may-be-null props (e.g. `seqVuln?.good_path \|\| null`, `eff?.frontier_points \|\| null`). If engine returns null/undefined, the user sees an authoritative-looking chart driven by mocks — no disclosure. | DEMO-BLOCKING |
| S-03 | CF-SCEN-02 | Same as S-02 but specifically the 5 mock scenarios include hardcoded annual drawdown figures (£38k / £34k / £28k / £46k) and PoS values (94% / 88% / 97% / 68%) that look real. | DEMO-BLOCKING |
| S-04 | CF-ED-01 | "UK 45-54 cohort median: 58%" — `cohortMedian = 58` is **hardcoded** in `EssentialsDiscretionarySplit`. Not engine-sourced, no provenance. | FUNCTIONAL |
| S-05 | dead code | The file defines `CashflowWaterfall`, `FundedRatioGauge`, `MonteCarloFanChart`, `SequenceOfReturnsCard`, `FiveScenariosCard`, `EfficientFrontierCard` (lines ~1207–2629) but **none are rendered** — V2 imports take precedence. ~1,200 lines of dead component code with diverging logic from the V2 versions. | POLISH→FUNCTIONAL (drift risk) |
| S-06 | CF-FUND-02 (FD-CF-1) | Verify the funded-ratio label fix (commit 533a8c0) held across all renderers. Stage B must check both `ConfidenceIntervalSummary` (fixed) AND `FundedRatioGaugeV2`'s status (already derives from ratio via `statusFor`), AND the hero proxy at CF-HERO-09. No other surface should display `fr.confidence` as a "ratio status". | FUNCTIONAL |
| S-07 | CF-COIV-02, CF-RE-03, CF-GS-01 | Internal codes surfaced at the top layer of the UI: "O-CF-RULES-12 (pending founder sign-off)", "O-CF-RULES-09", "X24 mode 3". Violates the macOS principle (internal codes never at top layer — see project memory `feedback_finio_macos_principle.md`). | FUNCTIONAL |
| S-08 | CF-HERO-08/09/10 vs CF-OVL-H-03 | Hero card uses spec-aligned labels (Bill coverage / Surplus ratio / Income resilience / Funded ratio / Debt service ratio). Drill panel uses different labels (Liquidity buffer / Surplus ratio / Debt manageability / Income resilience / Sequence resilience). Same surface, two label sets for the same components. | FUNCTIONAL |
| S-09 | CF-HERO-08, CF-HERO-09, CF-HERO-10 | Three of five "Cashflow Health Score" components are **UI-derived proxies**, not engine outputs. Income resilience = `(annInc − essAnn) / annInc`; Funded-ratio score = `clamp(fr.ratio × 100, 0, 100)`; Debt-service score = `100 − max(0, dsr − 10) × 100/30`. Score total is `health.total` from engine but the component breakdown the user sees is a different mix. A6 risk — score and its visible decomposition don't fully reconcile. | FUNCTIONAL |
| S-10 | CF-SUB-02, CF-ALLOC-03 | "+ Add manually (coming next)" and per-priority "Set up" CTAs are buttons but their onClick is only `console.info('[…] action:', …)` — no user-visible response. Honest label, but A2 (drillable) fails for keyboard users without an aria-live region. | FUNCTIONAL |
| S-11 | global | Brand-string drift check — engine modules + spec comments still reference Caelixa / Finio in some places. Cashflow.jsx top-comment says "Sonuswealth Cashflow tab · v3 POLISHED" (good), but `BRAND.disclaimer` content must be checked against Sonuswealth lock. | FUNCTIONAL |
| S-12 | CF-WAT-09 | Empty-state copy ("add a salary, dividend, rental or pension stream via **+ Income**") implies a "+ Income" affordance on the screen that doesn't exist in Cashflow.jsx. Verify the affordance lives elsewhere (My Money?) and that the copy points users there explicitly, or remove the implication. | POLISH→FUNCTIONAL |
| S-13 | CF-SUB-01 / CF-PRC-01 | "PRC – PCC" sub-anchor and PRC/PCC Spread card use undefined acronyms at the top layer. Even when stub, the name appears in the hero / sub-anchor without a plain-English explainer. | FUNCTIONAL |
| S-14 | CF-GS-04 | Goal-Seek paths render `humanise(p.action.kind)` — converts camelCase keys to title-case words. If engine returns a key like `bedAndIsa` user sees "Bed And Isa" not a plain-English action. A5 risk depending on `goalSeek` output vocabulary. | POLISH→FUNCTIONAL |

## COVERAGE MATH (this replaces "99% confident")

Total inventory rows (count at audit time; v1 = 102 including sub-rows).

```
Coverage  = (rows with verdict ≠ UNVERIFIED) / (total rows)
Pass rate = (rows PASS) / (rows PASS + rows FAIL)
```

A pass is **complete** only when Coverage = 100% (every row has a verdict).
The audit **terminates** per the runbook stopping rule — not at a round number.
"99% confident" is only a legitimate claim when Coverage = 100% and it is restated as:
*"X of Y rows verified PASS; Z FAIL, all POLISH-severity and backlogged."*
